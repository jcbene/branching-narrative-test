# branching-narrative-test

Quickly put together - mainly focused on drafting the potential file management flow and experiencing the fundamental joy of a branching narrative.
Consists of a simple story that branches and then branches again into related endings. Stylized with very barebones CSS - looking to tinker more with it later.
Currently, the way the story branches is through entire, separate HTML files that are linked with hrefs and anchors. This is a process that is too tedious to realistically manage, track, edit, or systematically change. When coding this, the structure felt like it was holding this story hostage, and I will look forward to alternative, more elegant methods.
