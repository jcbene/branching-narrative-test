# branching-narrative-test

Quickly put together - mainly focused on drafting the potential file mangement flow and experiencing the fundamental joy of a branching narrative.
Consists of a simple story that branches and then branches again into related endings.
Stylized with very barebones css - looking to tinker more with it later.
Currently, how the text/story branches works is limited by entire, seperate html files - all linked with href's and anchors - a process I think is way too tedious to realistically do, keep track of, edit, or systematically change. The structure is holding it hostage.
