        <p>The people of the village are wary at first, but not unkind. You work odd jobs—helping at the docks, mending nets, assisting the baker whose son left for the mainland years ago and never returned. Over time, faces soften.</p>
        <p>One evening, at the harbor’s edge, an old sailor with a missing eye tells you, “There’s a boat leaving in three days. The captain owes me a favor. I can get you on, if you’re ready.”</p>
        <p>But that same night, as you sit by the fire behind the bakery, you realize you’ve grown fond of this place. The stars here feel closer. The village breathes like something alive. And part of you wonders—what would staying look like?</p>
