        <p>The days fold into each other like linens. You take over the bakery. You learn to mend boats. On certain nights, you walk to the jungle’s edge and stare toward the stars, wondering what lies beyond.</p>
        <p>But the island whispers things only to those who listen. And one day, you feel it—you are no longer a guest. The island has accepted you. You are home.</p>
