        <p>The sky cracks open.</p>
        <p>A silent, pulsing light descends.</p>
        <p>It does not burn. It does not break. It simply beckons.</p>
        <p>You step into it, not sure if you’re still on the island, or if the island was ever an island at all. You’re not entirely you anymore. But you are free.</p>
        <p>And in the harbor, back in the village, someone new washes ashore.</p>
