        <h1>Where am I?</h1>
        <p>You wake to the sound of waves and gulls. The tide has dragged you ashore, your skin salted and your mind still humming with fragments of the storm. A jagged line of coconut palms towers over you, and inland, green rises like a breath held by the island itself.</p>
        <p>Your clothes are wet, torn, but you’re alive. You wander inland and, to your astonishment, stumble upon a village—not primitive, but quaint and almost... European in design. Stone paths. Shuttered windows. A bakery with the smell of something warm and sweet wafting out. Past that, a small harbor glimmers with boats gently knocking against wooden piers, though most seem... empty. And not all of them look seaworthy.</p>
        <p>To the west, the jungle looms deeper, denser, the trees ancient and oddly still. You heard stories of old mines, maybe ruins. There's even rumor from a passing fisherman about "the rogue star"—something celestial, something people here don't talk about much. But they fear it.</p>
        <a href="./public/exploreVillage.html"><h4>Explore the village, see if you can find a way to earn some favors, maybe enough to get a passage off the island through the harbor?</h4></a>
        <a href="./public/exploreForest.html"><h4>Or venture into the jungle, chasing whispers of gold, ruins, and other means of escape?</h4></a>
